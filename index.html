		<p class="general">As you can see the the number of overdoses have increased drastically; Almost exponentiall in the last couple years
		In our exploration of the data we have found that certain states have increased in the amount of drug overdoses per capita while others have either 
		maintained or, fortunately, decreased in drug overdoses per capita. 
		Let's take a closer lose at individual states in the U.S.

				White Americans experience the highest overdose death rate of all reported races. This would suggest drug addiction is a primarily White issue, however, because of this sentiment, other ethnicities remain out of discussion the regarding treatment of opiate addiction, which may have led to an increase in overdose death rates among less represented communities in more recent years.

		<p class="biggerText">Preventing Opioid Overdose as stated by the CDC</p>
		<p class="smallerText"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/injury/features/opioid-epidemic-stories/index.html">CDC Link</a></p>
		<p class="general">Raising awareness of how addictive and detrimental the drugs are to one's health is the key in slowing the 
			spread of drug overdoses. If more individuals in the United States become conscientious of how serious this 
			epidemic is, it could help slow the spread. The CDC recommends following these guidelines below:</p>
		<p class="preventionPoints"><b>1. Learn more about opioids so you can help people who are 
			most at risk for opioid use disorder and overdose in your community.</b></p>
		<p class="preventionPoints"><b>2. Help those struggling with opioid use disorder find the right care and treatment.</b></p>
		<p class="preventionPoints"><b>3. Increase awareness about opioid abuse, addiction, and overdose by sharing Rx Awareness messages.</b></p>
