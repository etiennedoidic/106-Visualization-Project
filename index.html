		<p class="general">Throughout the past two decades, the United States has experienced a significant increase in drug overdose death rates. 
			This could be indicative of an increasingly fatal drug addiction problem in the United States.
			In order to prevent this epidemic issue it is important to understand who and why we are experiencing accelerating amounts of deaths. 
			The National Center of Health Services has provided a dataset describing drug poisoning deaths at the U.S. and state level. 
			
			Below we have depicted a graph with the US Age-adjusted death rates in the U.S. from in 1999 to 2016.

		<p class="general">As we can see the the number of overdoses has increased drastically, almost exponentially in the last couple years.
		In our exploration of the CDC's VSRR dataset we have found that certain states have increased in their amount of drug overdoses per capita while others have either 
		maintained or, fortunately, decreased in drug overdoses per capita. The dataset also reports the drug which caused the overdose. It is important to understand that the data 
		is difficult to discern because drug mixing is a common cause of death.
		Let's take a closer lose at individual states in the U.S.

				White Americans experience the highest overdose death rate of all reported races. 
				This would suggest drug addiction is a primarily White issue, however, because of this sentiment, 
				other ethnicities remain out of discussion regarding the treatment of opiate addiction, which may 
				have led to an increase in overdose death rates among less represented communities in more recent years.

		<p class = 'center'>Men are about <strong>two times more likely</strong> to overdose from any drug. This is likely because men tend to take larger doses. In 2018 the per capita overdose death rate of all American men was 26.12 and 13.45 for women.<br><br>
			Women tend to be more receptive to treament for most drugs than men.
			A <a href = 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23313145/'>study</a> shows that women may be more likely to take prescription opioids 
			without a prescription to cope with pain, even when men and women report similar pain levels.
			Women are also more likely to <a href = 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23313145/'>misuse prescription opioids</a> to self-treat for other problems such as anxiety or tension</p>

			<div><p class="general">Younger men are more at risk of overdosing around ages 25-34 while in women, ages 45-54 are most at risk of overdose.
				 Some research 
				 indicates that women are more sensitive to pain than men68 and more likely to have chronic pain
				69 which could contribute to the high rates of opioid prescriptions among women of reproductive age.70
				 In addition, women may be more likely to take prescription opioids without a prescription to cope with pain, 
				 even when men and women report similar pain levels. Research also suggests that women are more likely to misuse
				  prescription opioids to self-treat for other problems such as anxiety or tension. 
				In A possible consequence of prescription opioid misuse is fatal overdose, which can occur because opioids suppress breathing. In 2016, 7,109 women and 9,978 men died from prescription opioid overdose (a total of 17,087)* which is about 19 women per day compared to about 27 men dying from overdosing on prescription opioids. However, from 1999 to 2016, deaths from prescription opioid overdoses increased more rapidly for women (596 percent or sevenfold) than for men (312 percent or fourfold). Women between the ages of 45 and 54 are more likely than women of other age groups to die from a prescription opioid overdose.72</p></div>

		<p class="general">This epidemic of drug overdoses is highly attributed to opioids, whether it be prescription opioids, 
			or drugs such as synthetic opioids or heroin. The extreme dominance of drug overdoses being attributed to opiods may be
			due to the tripling of opiod drug prescriptions by U.S. pharmacies from 1991 to 2011. As well, drug overdoses have
			increased due to the splicing of drugs with fentanyl, and the major increase of the illegal drug trade's production flooding
			the United States market. This increase in opioid prescriptions and other illicit drugs
			in combination with the stigma surrounding those who do drugs as "bad people" makes it hard for someone who has developed
			an addiction to quit, as stigma affects one's self-esteem, the relationships between their friends and family, and prevents
			individuals suffering from addiction to acquire easy access to treatments.
			Raising awareness of how addictive and detrimental the drugs are to one's health is the key in slowing the 
			spread of drug overdoses. If more individuals in the United States become conscientious of how serious this 
			epidemic is, it could help slow the spread. The CDC recommends following these guidelines below:</p>
		<p class="preventionPoints"><b>1. Learn more about drug addiction to help people who are 
			most at risk for drug use disorders and overdoses in your community.</b></p>
		<p class="preventionPoints"><b>2. Help those struggling with drug use disorders find the right care and treatment.</b></p>
		<p class="preventionPoints"><b>3. Increase awareness about drug abuse, addiction, and overdose by sharing Rx Awareness messages.</b></p>
